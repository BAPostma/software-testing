=== Exercise 2 ===

Description method of checking the definitions:
- Contradictions
According to the definition, an expression is a contradiction when all of its
evaluations yield false. Considering this definition, it is the opposite of
a tautology i.e. a negated tautological expression is a contradiction.

The most basic form of a contradiction is P ^ ¬P. By using several formulae
that have been proven to be contradictions on paper, we can test the method
that was written to yield the expected results.
Note that Prop 1 represents p and Prop 2 represents q.

p ^ ¬p					(Cnj [(Prop 1), (Neg (Prop 1))])
(q v q) ^ (¬p)^(¬q)		(Cnj [(Dsj [(Prop 1), (Prop 2)]), (Cnj [(Neg (Prop 1)), (Neg (Prop 2))])])
